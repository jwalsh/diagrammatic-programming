* Diagrammatic Programming

This repository contains examples and tooling to demonstrate a hermeneutic, collaborative approach to aligning system diagrams and code using LangChain.

** Approach

The `Architect` and `Coder` personas iteratively update diagrams and code respectively using LangChain prompts. This builds shared understanding of the system through circular refinement.

** Workflow 

[[./workflow.png]]


- Starting with an initial system diagram
- Converting the diagram to code
- Architect and Coder iteratively updating artifacts
- Validating once a fixed point is reached

* Diagrammatic Programming Examples

** Online Ordering System
- Diagram shows flow from browsing items, adding to cart, checkout, payment, order confirmation
- Code implements classes for cart, order, payment, etc.
** ATM Transaction
- Diagram models steps of inserting card, entering PIN, selecting transaction, dispensing cash, printing receipt
- Code handles user input, bank API calls, cash dispensing
** Video Streaming
- Diagram shows requesting video, loading, buffering, playback, pausing, resuming
- Code implements video player, network manager, codec classes
** Social Media Post
- Diagram models creating post, adding media, mentioning users, posting publically
- Code handles post creation, notifications, privacy settings
** Ride Sharing
- Diagram shows driver accepting ride, picking up passenger, driving route, dropping off
- Code coordinates locations, payments, driver assignment
** Banking System
- Diagram models account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, interest calculation
- Code implements account, transaction, interest logic
** Audio Transcription
- Diagram shows audio input, preprocessing, speech recognition, text output
- Code handles audio loading, normalization, speech-to-text API calls
